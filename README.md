## üìú Installation guide

### üêã Deploy with Docker

It is recommended to use [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) as it is very convenient. The following examples show simple deployment options:

#### Bridge network

```yaml
---
version: '3.9'

services:
  ddns:
    image: plaenkler/ddns-updater:latest
    container_name: ddns
    restart: always
    networks:
      - web
    ports:
      - 80:80
    volumes:
      - ./ddns:/app/data
    environment:
      - DDNS_INTERVAL=600
      - DDNS_TOTP=false
      - DDNS_PORT=80

networks:
  web:
    external: false
```

#### Macvlan network

```yaml
---
version: '3.9'

services:
  ddns:
    image: plaenkler/ddns-updater:latest
    container_name: ddns
    restart: always
    networks:
      web:
        ipv4_address: 10.10.10.2
    volumes:
      - ./ddns:/app/data
    environment:
      - DDNS_INTERVAL=600
      - DDNS_TOTP=false
      - DDNS_PORT=80

networks:
  web:
    name: web
    driver: macvlan
    driver_opts:
      parent: eth0
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: "10.10.10.0/24"
          ip_range: "10.10.10.0/24"
          gateway: "10.10.10.1"
```

> **Note:** DDNS Updater can also be deployed behind a proxy like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) or [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/).

### üìÑ Build from source

From the root of the source tree, run:

```text
go build -o ddns-updater.exe cmd/main.go
```

> **Note:** Make sure that [CGO](https://gist.github.com/Plaenkler/0c319b89fbc884a928612b7fdef97fbd) is operational!


### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Depending on personal preferences, there are several ways to configure DDNS Updater. Users can select from three different methods:

**1. User Interface (Frontend)**

The easiest way to configure DDNS Updater is to use the integrated web interface. This can be accessed via the browser at `http://host-ip`.
Changes to the interval take effect immediately. The program must be restarted for the other settings to take effect.

**2. Configuration File**

A config.yaml file is provided to store all settings. In the absence of this file, the program generates one. Users have the option to directly modify settings within this file. It is important to note that changes made here will only take effect upon restarting the program. Default settings within the file are as follows:

```yaml
Interval: 600
TOTP: false
Port: 80
Resolver: ""
```

**3. Environment Variables**

An alternative to the configuration file are environment variables. During the program start these are read they are superordinate to the configuration file.

```text
DDNS_INTERVAL=600
DDNS_TOTP=false
DDNS_PORT=80
DDNS_RESOLVER=ipv4.example.com
```
