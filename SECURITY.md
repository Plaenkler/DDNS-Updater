# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I am dedicated to ensure the security of DDNS Updater. To achieve this, I follow the Calendar Versioning (CalVer) scheme, where revisions are in the format "yy/week of year/revision".
I will only support the latest revision of each of the last three calendar weeks. Explanatory diagram:

| Version      | Supported          |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| 2023.30.2    | :white_check_mark: |
| 2023.30.1    | :x: |
| 2023.29.2    | :white_check_mark: |
| 2023.28.4    | :white_check_mark: |
| Older        | :x:                |
